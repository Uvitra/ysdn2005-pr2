			  <h2>Why this site?</h2>
				<p>
					This is a website designed to help people find out what’s out there for feeling on the inside! Anyone can use it from a soul searching mission to a quick refresher before heading out to a pride parade!
				</p>
				
				<h2>My letter is missing!</h2>
				<p>
					Drat! Rats! Fud-ruckers! Sorry about that! If you’d be so kind, fire an email to email@mailserver.com and we’ll add your representation lickity split!
				</p>
				
				<h2>What about the debate on the letters?</h2>
				<p>
					The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not agreed to by everyone that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes are not the same as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgender and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					That being said, this website's aim is to show a broad overview of the spectrum of sexual orientation, sexual attraction and gender identity. People regularly identify with one label or another or none of them or all of them; the point is, everything is fluid and the main thing is to find out who you are and be happy.
				</p>
				
				<h2>I want to learn more, where can I find more stuff on the like?</h2>

				<h2>A Rainbow Reading List</h2>
				
				<h3>The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America by Charles Kaiser <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1634156.The_Gay_Metropolis" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					Kaiser’s historical look at how gay men informed the culture of America’s urban areas — particularly New York City — spans 56 years from the periods of silent acceptance, the tumultuous pre-Stonewall years, the empowering ’70s, and the AIDS crisis of the ’80s.
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Velvet Rage: Overcoming the Pain of Growing Up in a Straight Man’s World by Alan Downs <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49418.The_Velvet_Rage" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					Psychologist Alan Downs takes a look at the resounding issues within the gay male community — substance abuse, depression, sex addiction, and shame — that still persist despite increasing social acceptance of homosexuality. The Velvet Rage is an important self-help text that puts into context the anger that stems out of one’s marginalized identity.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Before Night Falls by Reinaldo Arenas <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33833.Before_Night_Falls" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					The internationally renowned poet shares his life story, from his adolescence spent fighting for the Castro regime to his imprisonment for his sexuality to his flight from Cuba to his deathbed in New York City. It’s a powerful memoir that speaks to the personal and the political as well as the space where the two intersect.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Beyond Shame: Reclaiming the Abandoned History of Radical Gay Sexuality by Patrick Moore <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1344316.Beyond_Shame" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					Moore’s provocative take on the extreme sexual practices that came out of the ’70s attempts to remove the enduring shame that is the AIDS crisis’ legacy for that seemingly destructive sexual behavior. Moore argues a generation lost to the disease resulted in a lack of sexual awareness and pride among young gay men.
				</p>
				
				<h3>A Queer History of the United States by Michael Bronski <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10065595-a-queer-history-of-the-united-states" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					Bronski’s exhaustive text chronicles the history of non-heterosexual activity from the very beginnings of the country’s roots — beginning with Columbus’ arrival in 1492 and ending in the present day.
