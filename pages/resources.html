				<h3>The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America by Charles Kaiser <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1634156.The_Gay_Metropolis" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					Kaiser’s historical look at how gay men informed the culture of America’s urban areas — particularly New York City — spans 56 years from the periods of silent acceptance, the tumultuous pre-Stonewall years, the empowering ’70s, and the AIDS crisis of the ’80s.
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Velvet Rage: Overcoming the Pain of Growing Up in a Straight Man’s World by Alan Downs <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49418.The_Velvet_Rage" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					Psychologist Alan Downs takes a look at the resounding issues within the gay male community — substance abuse, depression, sex addiction, and shame — that still persist despite increasing social acceptance of homosexuality. The Velvet Rage is an important self-help text that puts into context the anger that stems out of one’s marginalized identity.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Before Night Falls by Reinaldo Arenas <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33833.Before_Night_Falls" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					The internationally renowned poet shares his life story, from his adolescence spent fighting for the Castro regime to his imprisonment for his sexuality to his flight from Cuba to his deathbed in New York City. It’s a powerful memoir that speaks to the personal and the political as well as the space where the two intersect.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Beyond Shame: Reclaiming the Abandoned History of Radical Gay Sexuality by Patrick Moore <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1344316.Beyond_Shame" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					Moore’s provocative take on the extreme sexual practices that came out of the ’70s attempts to remove the enduring shame that is the AIDS crisis’ legacy for that seemingly destructive sexual behavior. Moore argues a generation lost to the disease resulted in a lack of sexual awareness and pride among young gay men.
				</p>
				
				<h3>A Queer History of the United States by Michael Bronski <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10065595-a-queer-history-of-the-united-states" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<p>
					Bronski’s exhaustive text chronicles the history of non-heterosexual activity from the very beginnings of the country’s roots — beginning with Columbus’ arrival in 1492 and ending in the present day.

				<h3>Brokeback Mountain (2005) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<h4>Director: Ang Lee</h4>
				<h4>Cast: Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal</h4>
				<p>
					It made over £140 million worldwide, which means that Ang Lee’s muscular yet delicate cinematic interpretation of a slender Annie Proulx story will be hard to beat as the highest-grossing gay romance of all time. It’s something of a miracle that it reached such a summit – in addition to scoring eight Oscar nominations – without compromising the subtle, laconic sadness of Proulx’s prose. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal star in the tragedy-bound love story as strapping sheep-herders in 1960s Wyoming. Lines like ‘I wish I knew how to quit you’ immediately entered the all-time quote list. And to this day, no one can look at a flannel shirt on a hanger without getting misty-eyed.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Happy Together (1997) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Together_%281997_film%29" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<h4>Director: Wong Kar-wai</h4>
				<h4>Cast: Leslie Cheung, Tony Cheung</h4>
				<p>
					Love hurts in Wong Kar-wai's characteristically swoonworthy account of the codependent tango between impulsive Ho (Leslie Cheung) and down-to-earth Lai (Tony Cheung), a Hong Kong couple adrift on the other side of the world. Having decamped to Argentina, the pair prove incapable of nourishing one other yet equally incapable of ending the relationship that defines them. Powerful performances are supported by Wong's elliptical structure and the superb work of regular collaborators like cinematographer Christopher Doyle and production designer William Chang. Made in 1997, it's a metaphor for Hong Kong's handover to China and an unforgettably poignant bad romance.
				</p>
				
				<h3>My Own Private Idaho (1991) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Own_Private_Idaho" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<h4>Director: Gus van Sant</h4>
				<h4>Cast: River Phoenix, Keanu Reeves</h4>
				<p>
					For years, ‘playing gay’ was seen as a brave move for young male movie stars (what did Hollywood think: that straight women would get all confused and suddenly stop fancying their boy-crushes?). ‘My Own Private Idaho’ is the film that conclusively disproved that lazy assumption. River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves play a pair of rent-boy drifters on the streets of Seattle – and still the tweenies swooned and put their posters up on the walls. Gus van Sant’s film is dreamy, earthy and pretentious in the best sense, and both leads are impossibly beautiful.
				</p>
				
				<h3>All About My Mother (1999) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_About_My_Mother" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<h4>Director: Pedro Almodóvar</h4>
				<h4>Cast: Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Candela Peña</h4>
				<p>
					Pedro Almodovar’s filmography practically constitutes an LGBT cinema canon in itself. But this rich, ripe, wrenching Oscar winner from 1999 may represent his most generous Valentine to the community. It’s also the ideal bridging point between the messy, manic high camp of his earlier career and his later, more refined embrace of melodrama and ‘women’s cinema’. Cecilia Roth is Manuela, a grieving mother searching Barcelona’s colourful queer scene for the transvestite who unwittingly fathered her late son. If that sounds like a lot, Almodovar isn’t afraid to overload his film, incorporating pregnant nuns, stage divas and the Aids crisis into a heady stew. It’s a film that finally celebrates the togetherness of outsiders.
				</p>
				
				<h3>The Killing of Sister George (1968) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_of_Sister_George" target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
				<h4>Director: Robert Aldrich</h4>
				<h4>Cast: Beryl Reid, Susannah York, Coral Browne</h4>
				<p>
					Six years after delivering the 1962 Grand Guignol camp classic ‘What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?’, director Robert Aldrich was back at it with this towering exercise in macabre lesbian psychodrama. Beryl Reid wolfs down the scenery as June, an actor known and loved as sweet Sister George in a TV soap but in real life a boozed-up monster given to molesting nuns in taxi cabs. Her behaviour threatens both her work and her relationship with pliable Childie (Susannah York), yet Reid maintains our sympathy. The film includes scenes shot at real-life legendary London lesbian club the Gateways.
